# ðŸ§© Microservices App with FastAPI, RedisJSON, Redis Streams & React

This project demonstrates how to build a simple microservices-based application using **Python FastAPI** for backend services and **React** for the frontend. The system is composed of two microservices:

- **Inventory Service**
- **Payment Service**

It uses:
- **RedisJSON** as the NoSQL database (similar to MongoDB)
- **Redis Streams** as the Event Bus (similar to RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka)

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

### Backend
- **FastAPI** - High-performance web framework for Python
- **RedisJSON** - JSON-based NoSQL database
- **Redis Streams** - Event-driven architecture support

### Frontend
- **React** - Modern JavaScript frontend library

## ðŸ“¦ Microservices Overview

### ðŸ§¾ Inventory Service
- Manages product stock and availability.
- Stores product data in RedisJSON.
- Publishes stock update events to Redis Streams.

### ðŸ’³ Payment Service
- Handles payment processing logic.
- Listens to Redis Streams for inventory events.
- Updates payment status and business logic accordingly.

## ðŸ§° Features

- Microservices architecture
- Event-driven communication with Redis Streams
- NoSQL database with RedisJSON
- FastAPI for asynchronous, high-performance APIs
- React frontend to interact with backend services
